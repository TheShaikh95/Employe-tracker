# Employe-tracker

## MySQL Employee Tracker
CLI Content Management System to manage a company's employees. The application links to an SQL database and allows users to view and manage employee records from the command line interface in a more user friendly environment.

## Approach
Backend development, especially involving databases is a new concept to me. Breaking down the project I sought to complete the following objectives:

Get the SQL database and return it as a table in the command line by using linkages
The table should have the column names: id, first_name, last_name, title, department, salary, and manager (if applicable). Therefore the tables must be linked in some way
Allow the user to add or delete their own employees, roles, and departments
Allow the user to edit employee roles
To begin the project, I created a separate sql file, seed.sql, containing sample values to test the application's functionality.
